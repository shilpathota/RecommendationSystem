NuNu Tv Nursery Rhymes ‚ñ∫

At NuNu Tv, Our main goal is to produce entertaining and educational 3D animated video kid's songs that make preschool moments relatable and fun for families. These videos help preschoolers learn important concepts such as letters, numbers, animal sounds, colours, and more.

Our colourful animations and catchy songs showcase the common experiences of young children in their everyday lives. Our kids songs pass on prosocial life lessons, providing parents with an opportunity to teach and play with their children as they watch along.

We create songs for kids age six months to two years.

NuNu Tv - where Kids can learn and enjoy.

Lyrics: 

I jump in the bathtub, it‚Äôs time to get all clean
I‚Äôll be the cleanest kid you‚Äôve ever seen!
The soap and the bubbles are filling up the tub,
So I‚Äôll jump in the water and scrub, scrub, scrub!

Wash my hair, do do do do do do
Wash my hair, do do do do do do
Wash my hair, do do do do do do
Wash my hair!

Wash my face do do do do do do
Wash my face do do do do do do
Wash my face do do do do do do
Wash my face!

Wash my arms do do do do do do
Wash my arms do do do do do do
Wash my arms do do do do do do
Wash my arms!

Wash my hands do do do do do do
Wash my hands do do do do do do
Wash my hands do do do do do do
Wash my hands!

Wash my knees do do do do do do
Wash my knees do do do do do do
Wash my knees do do do do do do
Wash my knees!

Wash my toes do do do do do do
Wash my toes do do do do do do
Wash my toes do do do do do do
Wash my toes!
